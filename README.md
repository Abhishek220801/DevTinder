# 🚀 DevConnect — Developer Networking Platform

DevConnect is a full-stack developer networking platform built to understand how real-world systems are designed, secured, and scaled — not just how CRUD apps work.

This project focuses on **backend architecture, authentication, data modeling, and production-ready workflows**, with a modern frontend layered on top.
